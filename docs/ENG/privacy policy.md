# PRIVACY POLICY FOR COINBARPAY POS
Dear merchant,

Thank you for choosing to contribute to the adoption of cryptocurrency payments by installing the CoinbarPay app. We would like to present our privacy policy for the CoinbarPay POS service.

This document contains a brief general introduction on the collection of personal data and a second specific part on the data acquired and managed within the CoinbarPay POS service.

Coinbar is committed to complying with privacy regulations and, more generally, protecting personal data.

In particular, the "General Data Protection Regulation" EU 2016/679 (known by the acronym "GDPR") requires providing the following information on the processing of personal data, pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 of the aforementioned Regulation.

"Processing of Personal Data" means any operation concerning any "information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person."

Name and surname, an email address with a "username" identifying a person (e.g. mariorossi@â€¦), are considered "Personal Data," as well as the wallet of the funds transferred to Coinbar, accompanied by the personal data of its owner.

Collecting information that can be classified as Personal Data, recording them in our systems, and using them to provide you with the services offered by Coinbar, or even just to send you a communication, are considered Processing operations. Similarly, the communication of such information to other parties and their storage are considered Processing operations. The website of the Guarantor for the Protection of Personal Data contains further useful information to better understand the topic (see, for example: http://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/diritti).

Coinbar S.p.a. thus acts as the "Data Controller," which establishes how and for what purposes information relating to natural persons is processed.

You, Coinbar Customers, as "natural or legal persons to whom personal data relates," are defined as "Data Subjects," and have the right to receive the following information on who we are, what personal data we process, why, how, and for how long we process them, and what obligations and rights are recognized.

The collection of Data, whose nature is subsequently specified, is an essential step to be able to provide the CoinbarPay service.

The definitions of terms and expressions used in the following information are contained in the Privacy Glossary, which can be viewed at this address: https://coinbar.io/glossario-privacy
